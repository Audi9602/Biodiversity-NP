# Biodiversity in National Parks
I have made a project from codecademy. Biodiversity in National Parks. It explores and analyses data from two csv files. I made this project from [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com). The goal of this project is to analyze biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, particularly around various species observed in different national park locations. I used both the datasets namely, `Observations.csv` and `Species_info.csv` were provided by the website itself (data might be *inspired* by real data, but is mostly fictional).

This Project is wholly about analysis the data using tests and plotting it as a result. I used Python as a programming language and Google Colab as the code editor.
